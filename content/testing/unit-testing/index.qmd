# Unit Testing Best Practices

Unit testing is the foundation of a solid testing strategy. This chapter covers essential unit testing concepts and practices.

## What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing involves testing individual components or functions in isolation. A unit test typically follows this pattern:

1. Arrange - Set up the test conditions
2. Act - Execute the code being tested
3. Assert - Verify the results

## Writing Good Unit Tests

Here are some key principles:

- Test one thing at a time
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the FIRST principles:
  - Fast
  - Independent
  - Repeatable
  - Self-validating
  - Timely

## Example Test Case

```python
def test_add_numbers():
    # Arrange
    a = 5
    b = 3
    expected = 8
    
    # Act
    result = add_numbers(a, b)
    
    # Assert
    assert result == expected
```

## Common Pitfalls

- Testing implementation details
- Brittle tests
- Poor test isolation
- Missing edge cases
