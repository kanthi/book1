# Integration Testing Strategies

Integration testing ensures that different components of your system work together correctly.

## Understanding Integration Tests

Integration tests verify the interaction between:

- Multiple functions or classes
- Different modules or services
- External dependencies
- Database interactions

## Testing Approaches

### Top-Down Integration

Start with high-level components and gradually test lower-level modules:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[UI Layer] --> B[Business Logic]
    B --> C[Data Access]
    C --> D[Database]
```

### Bottom-Up Integration

Begin with low-level components and progressively test higher layers.

## Best Practices

1. Use test doubles when needed:
   - Mocks
   - Stubs
   - Fakes

2. Focus on component interfaces
3. Test realistic scenarios
4. Consider error conditions
